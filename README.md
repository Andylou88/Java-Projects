# Java-Projects
This repository will hold the projects that I have been working on as an portfolio extension

# MY Login Application
The first Project is a login web application that allows you to create an account login and edit your account. 
You can also list all of the users in the accounts as well. I may upload the database information later on but 
for now you'll have to create you own database and tables. If your curious as to what database I used to build and test my data,
I used MySQL workbench to test the application.
